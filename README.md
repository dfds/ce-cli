# Cloud Engineering CLI

CLI tool used by DFDS' Cloud Engineering teeam used for mass-manage various cloud resources, e.g. across all AWS accounts in our AWS Organization.

For AWS, the idea more specifically is to have an easy-to-use way of deploying resources, that requires very high privileges - i.e. the ability to assume the organization role in each AWS account.

With this, it's easy to provision IAM roles with lesser privileges that can then be used for various use cases, like running performing inventory of AWS accounts (more or less only `Get*`, `List*`, `Describe*` permissions).

Currently, the only supported resources are AWS-related, and each command therefore will start with `ce-cli aws <command>`.

## Getting help

Use the `--help` argument to get help for the current command scope, e.g. `ce-cli aws --help`, `ce-cli aws create-predefined-iam-role --help`.

## Features

### AWS

All the AWS commands currently the AWS Organization, and attempts to assume the organization role in each account, thus requires admin rights to the billing account. It uses the AWS SDK's default credential search order.

The suggested way to authenticate, is to login using `saml2aws` and assume the billing admin role. Then set the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable profile used by `saml2aws` (by default `saml`).

#### AWS commands

| Command                           | Description                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `create-predefined-iam-role`      | Create a pre-defined IAM role, based on policies read from the S3 bucket.                     |
| `delete-iam-role`                 | Delete the specified IAM role.                                                                |
| `create-oidc-provider`            | Create an IAM Open ID Connect Provider using the endpoint e.g. from EKS cluster.              |
| `update-oidc-provider-thumbprint` | Updates the thumbprint associated with an IAM Open ID Connect Provider.                       |
| `delete-oidc-provider`            | Delete an IAM Open ID Connect Provider.                                                       |
| `list-org-accounts`               | Returns all AWS accounts in the Organization, optionally filtered by `--include-account-ids`. |

At least the `create-predefined-iam-role` command requires a backend bucket is specified (see "Backend S3 bucket"), and a role ARN to assume in order to read from it.

Example:

```bash
ce-cli aws create-predefined-iam-role --bucket-name "${BACKEND_S3_BUCKET}" --bucket-role-arn "${BACKEND_IAM_ROLE_ARN}" --role-name "inventory"
```

Substitute `${BACKEND_S3_BUCKET}` and `${BACKEND_IAM_ROLE_ARN}` (typically in the *security* account).

#### Common AWS arguments

| Argument                  | Short | Description                                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--include-account-ids`   | `-i`  | Filter the AWS Organization account IDs.<br>If omitted, *all* accounts in the Organization are returned. |
| `--exclude-account-ids`   | `-e`  | Specifically exclude the specified account IDs.                                                          |
| `--path`                  | `-p`  | The path (prefix) for resource names where applicable, e.g. IAM roles.                                   |
| `--concurrent-operations` | `-c`  | Maximum number of concurrent operations for parallel operations.                                         |

## Backend S3 bucket

All policy documents for the predefined AWS IAM roles are read from the specified S3 bucket. In the future, other templates and configuration might be read from here.

We have provisioned this bucket in our *security* account. An IAM role is needed to access the bucket, which can be assumed by an admin of the AWS billing account.

### Backend bucket IAM policies

**Permission policy:**

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::${BACKEND_S3_BUCKET}/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::${BACKEND_S3_BUCKET}"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Substitute `${BACKEND_S3_BUCKET}`.

**Trust policy:**

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::${BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID}:root"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Condition": {}
        }
    ]
}
```

Substitute `${BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID}`.

### Backend bucket structure

The expected structure for AWS IAM role files in the bucket is:

`aws/iam/${PREDEFINED_ROLE_NAME}-role/`.

The following files are needed:

| File              | Description                                                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `policy.json`     | The inline permission policy document to attach                                      |
| `properties.json` | Various properties for the role, including any managed permission policies to attach |
| `trust.json`      | The role trust policy document                                                       |

#### `properties.json`

The `properties.json` file contains the following properties:

| Property          | Description                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `description`     | Role description                  |
| `sessionDuration` | Maximum role session duration     |
| `path`            | Role name prefix (aka. path)      |
| `managedPolicies` | List of IAM policy ARNs to attach |

Example file for the `inventory` predefined IAM role:

```json
{
    "description" : "Inventory role description.",
    "sessionDuration" : 28800,
    "path" : "/managed/",
    "managedPolicies" : [
        "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/job-function/ViewOnlyAccess"
    ]
}
```

## Roadmap

- Support providing semi-static configuration, such as the backend S3 bucket name (used e.g. for policy templates) through a config file and/or environment variables
